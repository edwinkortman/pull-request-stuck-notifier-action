# Pull Request Stuck Notifier GitHub Action

Automatically label and mention/notify a user about stuck pull requests.

This is primarily useful if you use a dependency update bot such as
[Dependabot][dependabot], [Greenkeeper][greenkeeper], or [Renovate][renovate]
and have configured their pull requests to be merged automatically. This action
will catch unmerged PRs that may be stuck because of a failing GitHub status
check.

This action pairs very well with the [Auto Approve action by Harry Marr][auto-approve].

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a label in your repo to assign to stuck pull requests.

The default label this action uses is "stuck", but you can use any label.

**!!! The label must be setup before using this action. !!!**

### Inputs

:heavy_exclamation_mark: = Required

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="1%">&nbsp;</th>
      <th width="20%">Input</th>
      <th width="10%">Default</th>
      <th width="69%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>:heavy_exclamation_mark:</td>
      <td>repo-token</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Input for `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>cutoff</td>
      <td>24h</td>
      <td>The cutoff time period before a pull request is considered stuck. The value will be passed to the [ms][ms] package.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>label</td>
      <td>stuck</td>
      <td>
        Name of the label to assign to stuck pull requests.<br />
        <strong>The supplied label must already exist. This action will not create a new label.</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>:heavy_exclamation_mark:</td>
      <td>message</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>The comment message to post on the pull request to notify a user.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>:heavy_exclamation_mark:</td>
      <td>search-query</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
        Search query to pass to the pull request search.<br/>
        The value provided will be appended to the base search query, which looks something like this:<br />
        "repo:${GITHUB_REPOSITORY} is:pr is:open created:<=${createdSinceSuteOff} -label:${stuckLabel}"
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Example workflow

Find and update [Dependabot][dependabot] pull requests that have not been automatically merged in 24 hours (default cutoff).
